# Audition-API-

## What Problem does this project solve?
<p>As an actor for over 10 years, I found it incredibly hard to keep track of the thousands of auditions I had done throughout a single year. Sometimes you may book a job or get a callback 2 months down the line, you may not remember what you wore, any notes the casting director gave you or even what the project was. 

My intent is to overcome these setbacks through the implementation of an Audition database

The featues of this database will allow an actor to store information relating to the auditions they have completed. </p>

Base features will include the ability for an actor to store information such as  -

Base features will include the ability for an actor to store information such as  -

- Project name 
- Casting director of project
- Date
- Location
- Comment section (Here we can input anything noteworthy, such as a piece of direction you received in your audition, what you wore etc. Can also store links to any audition tapes you did.

Advanced features -

My goal is to implement these features, but depending on how successful I am with the base features they may not take priority.

- Script upload ability (Can upload pdf audition material via a 3rd party site.)

- Photo upload ability (Can take a photo of the outfit you wore on the day and upload it to a 3rd party website.

This could not only be useful for actors but casting directors to also utilise.
